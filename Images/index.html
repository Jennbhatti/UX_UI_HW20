    In this research project, I planned and conducted 2 rounds of interviews with potential users as well as interviews constructed a google survey. From there I designed the section that allows users to offer and request services, as well as the pages where the services are listed on. I was also responsible for the construction and design of the community page. Through usability testing I also iterated the navigation bar.
